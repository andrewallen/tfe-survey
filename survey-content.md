# Welcome - All Members

Thank you for being part of the TFE family!

Everyone joins TFE with unique goals—whether that's building strength, improving endurance, finding community, or simply having fun. This survey is designed to help us shape our future class timetable, facilities, and services to better match your needs.

The survey features both required and optional questions. We've aimed to keep it clear and efficient, while still allowing you to share detailed feedback if you wish. It should take between 10 and 30 minutes to complete, depending on how much optional feedback you choose to provide.

Your insights will help:
- TFE leadership make decisions about timetables, class formats, and the wider gym experience.
- You and other members benefit from a schedule, environment, and community that truly reflect your preferences and goals.

All responses are anonymous, confidential, and deeply appreciated. Thank you for helping to shape the future of TFE!
