# Welcome - All Members

Thank you for being part of the TFE family!

Everyone joins TFE with unique goals - whether that's building strength, improving endurance, finding community, or simply having fun. This survey is designed to help us shape our future class timetable, facilities, and services to better match your needs.

The survey features both required and optional questions. We've aimed to keep it clear and efficient, while still allowing you to share detailed feedback if you wish. It should take between 10 and 30 minutes to complete, depending on how much optional feedback you choose to provide.

Your insights will help:
- TFE leadership make decisions about timetables, class formats, and the wider gym experience.
- You and other members benefit from a schedule, environment, and community that truly reflect your preferences and goals.

All responses are anonymous, confidential, and deeply appreciated. Thank you for helping to shape the future of TFE!

## Design your perfect TFE week (1/2)

We'd love your help designing the ultimate TFE class timetable. This section invites you to build your ideal training week by selecting the type of session you'd most like to attend in each time slot. You can fill in as many or as few slots as you wish — and you're welcome to choose more than one session per day if that fits your training rhythm.

To keep things simple, we've grouped classes by function rather than specific names. This allows you to focus on your fitness goals — whether that's building strength, improving your technique, hitting a new performance target, or just getting a great sweat in.

The dropdowns include:
Skill-building / Technique - For learning the basics or improving form (e.g. Foundations, Fundamentals)
Full-body Strength / General Conditioning - For building overall strength and structure (e.g. Build-full body, Strength Bootcamp)
Targeted Strength / Hypertrophy - For muscle-building and lift-focused sessions (e.g. Build-upper/lower, Squat, Bench, Deadlift)
HIIT / Functional Circuit - For time-efficient, high-intensity training (e.g. Metcon, Bootcamp-Hybrid/Cardio)
Performance / Competitive Conditioning - For those who enjoy metrics, challenge, and structured progression (e.g. Hyrox)
Boxing Fitness - For cardio, coordination, and stress release (e.g. BoxFit)
Recovery & Mobility - For injury prevention, movement quality, and wellbeing
Open Gym - For solo workouts in your own time
Personal Training - For bespoke 1:1 coaching

There are no wrong answers. Just think about the sessions that would genuinely help you feel stronger, more confident, or more consistent — and the times of day you'd be most likely to attend. Your input helps us build a smarter, member-centred timetable.
