# Current Members - Welcome Content

## Welcome

Thank you for being part of the TFE family!

Everyone joins TFE with unique goals—whether that's building strength, improving endurance, finding community, or simply having fun. This survey is designed to help us shape our future class timetable, facilities, and services to better match your needs.

The survey features both required and optional questions. We've aimed to keep it clear and efficient, while still allowing you to share detailed feedback if you wish. Most people finish in 7–12 minutes, or up to about 20 minutes if you add lots of comments.

Your insights will help:
- TFE leadership make decisions about timetables, class formats, and the wider gym experience.
- You and other members benefit from a timetable, environment, and community that truly reflect your preferences and goals.

We’ll share aggregated results with members in July.

All responses are anonymous, confidential, and deeply appreciated. Thank you for helping to shape the future of TFE!

Your answers will be stored securely and processed in accordance with GDPR and UK data‑protection regulations. See our privacy statement for details.
